This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Web, Server.

* [/composeApp](./composeApp/src) is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
    - [commonMain](./composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin) is for code that’s common for all targets.
    - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
      For example, if you want to use Apple’s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
      the [iosMain](./composeApp/src/iosMain/kotlin) folder would be the right place for such calls.
      Similarly, if you want to edit the Desktop (JVM) specific part, the [jvmMain](./composeApp/src/jvmMain/kotlin)
      folder is the appropriate location.

* [/server](./server/src/main/kotlin) is for the Ktor server application.

* [/shared](./shared/src) is for the code that will be shared between all targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is [commonMain](./shared/src/commonMain/kotlin). If preferred, you
  can add code to the platform-specific folders here too.

### Build and Run Server

To build and run the development version of the server, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE’s toolbar or run it directly from the terminal:

- on macOS/Linux
  ```shell
  ./gradlew :server:run
  ```
- on Windows
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :server:run
  ```

### Build and Run Web Application

To build and run the development version of the web app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE's toolbar or run it directly from the terminal:

- for the Wasm target (faster, modern browsers):
    - on macOS/Linux
      ```shell
      ./gradlew :composeApp:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun
      ```
    - on Windows
      ```shell
      .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun
      ```
- for the JS target (slower, supports older browsers):
    - on macOS/Linux
      ```shell
      ./gradlew :composeApp:jsBrowserDevelopmentRun
      ```
    - on Windows
      ```shell
      .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:jsBrowserDevelopmentRun
      ```

### Environments (local / staging / prod)

The web app reads environment config from a generated Kotlin file at build time.
Gradle also injects the values into `<meta>` tags in
`composeApp/src/webMain/resources/index.html` for easier debugging.

Override the environment and API base URL via Gradle properties:

- local (default): `./gradlew :composeApp:jsBrowserDevelopmentRun -PappEnv=local -PapiBaseUrl=http://localhost:8080`
- staging: `./gradlew :composeApp:jsBrowserProductionWebpack -PappEnv=staging -PapiBaseUrl=https://staging-api.your-domain.com`
- prod: `./gradlew :composeApp:jsBrowserProductionWebpack -PappEnv=prod -PapiBaseUrl=https://api.your-domain.com`

Defaults live in `composeApp/build.gradle.kts` and can be adjusted later.

### Trunk-based workflow (recommended)

- `main` is the trunk.
- Short-lived feature branches are merged quickly into `main`.
- Staging deploys from `main`.
- Production deploys from tags (e.g., `v1.2.3`) on `main`.
- PR preview environments can be added later as a CI/CD step.
